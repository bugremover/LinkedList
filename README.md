# Linked List Example in C++

## Overview

This repository contains a simple example of a linked list implemented in C++. The code defines a linked list structure, creates a linked list with a few nodes, and then traverses and displays the elements.

## Code Structure

### 1. `main.cpp`

The `main.cpp` file contains the main code for creating, populating, and traversing the linked list. Let's break down each section:

#### Node Structure Definition

```cpp
struct node {
    int val;
    struct node* ptr;
};
```

- This defines a simple structure named `node` with two members: an integer `val` representing the value of the node, and a pointer `ptr` pointing to the next node in the linked list.

#### Display Function

```cpp
void display(struct node* h) {
    while (h != NULL) {
        cout << h->val << "->";
        h = h->ptr;
    }
    cout << "NULL" << endl;
}
```

- The `display` function takes a pointer to the head of the linked list as an argument and traverses the list, printing each node's value followed by an arrow (`->`). It terminates by printing "NULL" when the end of the list is reached.

#### Main Function

```cpp
int main() {
    struct node n1, n2, n3, n4;
    struct node* head, * temp;

    // Initializing nodes with values
    n1.val = 10;
    n1.ptr = NULL;
    n2.val = 20;
    n2.ptr = NULL;
    n3.val = 30;
    n3.ptr = NULL;
    n4.val = 40;
    n4.ptr = NULL;

    // Connecting nodes to form a linked list
    n1.ptr = &n2;
    n2.ptr = &n4;
    n4.ptr = &n3;
    n3.ptr = NULL;

    // Setting the starting point of traversal
    temp = &n1;
    head = temp;

    // Displaying the linked list
    display(temp);

    return 0;
}
```

- Nodes `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and `n4` are created, each initialized with a value and a `NULL` pointer.
- The nodes are connected to form a linked list. `n1` points to `n2`, `n2` points to `n4`, `n4` points to `n3`, and `n3` points to `NULL`.
- The `temp` and `head` pointers are set to the head of the linked list (`n1`).
- The `display` function is called with the `temp` pointer, resulting in the traversal and printing of the linked list.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bugremover/LinkedList.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd LinkedList
    ```

3. Compile and run the program:

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o LinkedList
    ./LinkedList
    ```

You should see the output:

```plaintext
10->20->40->30->NULL
```

## Conclusion

This example provides a basic understanding of creating and traversing a linked list in C++. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different linked list configurations.
