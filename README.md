# Linked List Operations in C++

## Introduction

This repository provides a basic example of creating and traversing a linked list in C++. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence. This README will guide you through creating a linked list and traversing its elements.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
or use Replit `https://replit.com`





### Creating a Linked List

1. Open the `main.cpp` file in your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Find the `main` function and locate the section where nodes are created and connected. Modify this section to create your linked list. For example:

    ```cpp
    struct node n1, n2, n3;
    struct node* head, * temp;

    n1.val = 10;
    n1.ptr = NULL;
    n2.val = 20;
    n2.ptr = NULL;
    n3.val = 30;
    n3.ptr = NULL;

    n1.ptr = &n2;
    n2.ptr = &n3;

    temp = &n1;
    head = temp;
    ```

### Traversing the Linked List

1. In the `main` function, find the section where the `display` function is called. Uncomment this section to traverse and display the linked list:

    ```cpp
    display(temp);
    ```

2. Compile and run your program to see the linked list traversal:

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o linked-list
    ./linked-list
    ```

You should see the output:

    ```plaintext
    10->20->30->NULL
    ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created and traversed a linked list in C++. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different linked list configurations.
